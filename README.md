This is the first individual project in the technigo bootcamp and the focus was
to learn more about how to make responsive web pages.

## The problem

I've used flexbox and grid to structure the page together 
with media queries to make it responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop.
If I had more time I would have played around more 
with hover effects, styling and tried some CSS animations.
